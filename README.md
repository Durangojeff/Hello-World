# Hello-World
Just another repository because the nice artical said to make it. And I always do what a computer tells me to do just in case it turns into some 
kind of AI with a bent for human distruction. I mean, that would be bad but at least I might end up as some curiosity on in a human
menagery. At least it isn't making me type in 4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42 every 108 minutes.

I have never done anything like programing and circuitry before. I have been interested in learning for some time. I think that it would 
be interesting to integrate it into my artwork. But for now i am trying to learn it for work.
