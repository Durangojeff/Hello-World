# Hello-World
A repository because the nice artical said to make it. And I always do what a computer tells me to do just in case it turns into some 
kind of AI with a bent for human distruction. I mean, that would be bad but at least I might end up as some curiosity on in a human
menagery. At least it isn't making me type in 4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42 every 108 minutes.
